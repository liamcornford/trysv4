State of the Browser 2018 was a wonderful conference. The talks were thought-provoking and varied, the whole day was organised brilliantly, and the tickets were so reasonably priced.

## Super-powered Layouts with CSS Grid and CSS Variables

Michelle Barker kicked off the event tackling CSS Grid Layout & CSS Custom Properties. It was amazing - there were so many knowledge-bombs dropped.

The square-bracket syntax for line names had totally passed me by till now! _Sidenote: I love it when you learn something new about a language you've been writing for a while. The `turn` unit knocked me for six the other day_. The `-start` and `-end` suffixes was another brilliant revelation.

Combining Grid and Custom properties was so exciting! Both specs have been written in such a thoughtful manner, and clearly built to solve real-world problems. It shouldn't be a surprise that they work well together, but it is!

One key reason I attend conferences is to be inspired, and Michelle's talk did just that. I was furiously scribbling notes throughout the day as new ideas arrived on how to incorporate custom properties into my CSS.

## Moving toward Web 3.0 in Brave

If inspiration is one reason to attend a conference, having ideas challenged has to be another. This second talk by Dr. Ben Livshits certainly provoked some thoughts!

Brave looks like a totally different challenger in the browser market. It's new, it's different, and I'm still not really sure how I feel about it! But that's cool!

The goals sound noble:

- Private by default
- Reform digital ads
- Pay users to browse

And the Basic Attention Token (BAT) appears to be an interesting approach to tracking behaviour. But the BAT is also used as currency, and this is where the Brave direction started to feel uncomfortable.

It encourages paywalls. If reforming digital ads means walling off the open web, then stop the train and count me out.

This talk generated so much discussion at lunch and I'm so glad to have heard it. When discussing Brave, we conceded that we take for granted just how established and shady the current 'system' is. Google Chrome, Google Adwords, Google Analytics - there's a trend here.

I think the feeling of discomfort was partly due to a new and potentially disruptive technology, but also it made us stop and thinkg about the current landscape a little more.

## Stop the #divFest!

Sara's talk was brilliant. It was a fast-paced and hilarious dive into the div-soup that makes up many web applications.

It's a subject I feel strongly about being a passionate supporter of semantic HTML.

`<svg role="img">` was another nugget that's getting integrated pronto. I had know idea AT devices read out SVG tags when that role isn't set!

## The web, apps, web apps, and other Venn diagrams

There was a lot to digest in this talk, definitely one to re-watch. Rowan Merewood discussed what users require from our sites and apps.

We focus so much on the technology stack, the design, the UX, the right approach, the correct tracking model. But to users, **our sites and apps are implementation details**. They have a goal, our job is to help them meet it, simple as that.

This is a mind shift from app-centric to task-centric.

A great example Rowan showed was contrived from the idea of buying a sofa. Most customers are not in the business of buying sofas everyday (looking at you Amazon and your suggest products feed). Bombarding a user with newsletter signups, push notification requests, and add to homescreen popups too early on the process is futile. They'll quite rightly block the requests and might even get fed up enough to try a different site.

Instead, we can view their visit in a task-centric, and look to help them with their specific goal. Don't prompt the user to add the whole site to their homescreen from the offset. Catch that event, and serve it when they've invested some time - perhaps once they've ordered?

Better still, look into creating micro PWAs that serve the single purpose of handling their order. It stands to reason that a customer will be more likely to install a PWA that is relevant, timely and concise.

Follow the same approach with push notifications. Use the web platform tools we've been given wisely.

## WebXR and the Immersive Web

Ada shared about the amazing possibilities of Web XR. Virtual reality and augmented reality are two ends of the same spectrum.

The most encouraging part of this talk was seeing how much care is going into developing this spec. The transition from desktop to mobile was shaky, so it's amazing to hear how browsers and companies are preparing for this next shift. Pokemon Go showed the world how massive XR can be, so we need to be ready to steward this new medium well.

She raised a really interesting point about the problem with native XR apps. We know how large 'normal' native apps can get, and how expensive their daily updates are for many users. Native XR apps are an order of magnitude larger. And when each content provider creates their own walled product, it's going to be expensive.

Web XR will be the only viable option to get XR to the masses.

## How to be a Web A/V Artist Part 2: Picking Up the Threads

Ruth John talked about Web Audio and visualisations, but the key part of the talk was on web workers and worklets.
